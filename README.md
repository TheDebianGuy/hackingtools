## Trolling framework
Build to make fun off script kiddies that will execute any code you send them without inspection, use for fun but do not harm.
These scripts are really poorly coded, but friend gave me 24 hours so Im trying to make as much as possible, expect improvement in the future.
This little 'project' was made because I wanted to excercise in as many languages as possible.

### Windows platform

#### 4 (Python) - while True: webbrowser.open('https://pornhub.com'), with 4 threads it was able to break pc, lowered to 2 threads
